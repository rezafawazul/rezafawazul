🛠️ Former Engineer turned Data Enthusiast

📚 I’m currently learning Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI (beginner level)

🌱 Always looking to collaborate and learn from others

📫 How to reach me: LinkedIn

⚡ Fun fact: I’m quickly improving in AI prompting and problem analysis, and I believe collaborating with a mentor or partner could be mutually beneficial, as it would allow us to share knowledge and explore new ideas together!
